# Alexa Skills Kit Music API model for Java (alexa-music-skill-model-4j)
This project implements the Music API part of the Alexa Skills Kit using Java.

Basis for this project:
https://developer.amazon.com/docs/music-skills/api-reference-overview.html ; and
https://developer.amazon.com/docs/music-skills/catalog-reference.html .

At the time of this project's creation, the Alexa Skills Kit did not provide a Java implementation of the Music API; hence the purpose of this project.
